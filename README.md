# 🏗️ Python OOP Assignment  

This project shows basic **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python.  
It covers two parts:  
1. **Designing a Class**  
2. **Polymorphism Challenge**

## ✨ Part 1: Design Your Own Class  

I created a class for **Africa Ability Trust**, a disability center in Kibera, Nairobi.  
It has services like **Therapy, Training, and Counselling**.  

### Features:  
- Uses a **constructor (`__init__`)** to set name, location, and services.  
- Has methods to **show information** and **provide a service**.  
- Demonstrates how objects are created and used.

### 🖥️ Example Output:  
```text
Africa Ability Trust is in Kibera, Nairobi
We offer:
- Therapy

- Counselling
Now providing: Therapy
Now providing: Counselling

## 🎭 Part 2: Polymorphism Challenge  

I made different **vehicles** that all have the same action called `move()`.  
Each vehicle defines the action differently.  

### Vehicles and Actions:  
- Car → `Driving 🚗`  
- Plane → `Flying ✈️`  
- Boat → `Sailing 🚤`  

### 🖥️ Example Output:
--- Polymorphism Example ---
Driving 🚗
Flying ✈️
Sailing 🚤

2. Open a terminal or command prompt.  
3. Run the file with:  
   ```bash
